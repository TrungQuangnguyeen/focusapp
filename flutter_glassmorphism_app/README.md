## Features

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd flutter_glassmorphism_app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. Then, run the following command to install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   You can run the app using the following command:
   ```bash

   ```

## Usage

The main entry point of the application is located in `lib/main.dart`. The `MyApp` class in `lib/app.dart` sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home screen, which is implemented in `lib/screens/home_screen.dart`.

The glassmorphic effect is achieved using the `GlassmorphicContainer` widget defined in `lib/widgets/glassmorphic_container.dart`. You can customize the appearance by modifying the constants defined in `lib/utils/constants.dart`.
